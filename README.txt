TO RUN:
Our game can be run a UNIX operating system. To run our program: type "python game.py" in the terminal. A welcome screen and the player will be asked to enter a difficulty level between 1 and 5 (1 = easiest, 5 = hardest). After selecting a difficulty level and pressing [enter], the corresponding map will appear on the screen.  Note: The player is indicated by a '0' while the boundary/walls are indicated by '#'.

TO PLAY:
The game uses a classic W,A,S,D movement interface. The player must first select a direction to move and then press [enter]. 'W' moves the player up. 'A' moves the player left. 'S' moves the player down. 'D' moves the player right. 

RULES:
If the player, '0', hits a land mine (indicated with an underscore, '_') the player loses the game.
Once the player has lost the game, they can press any key to exit the program. The player's movement is bounded between the walls, '#', so that the player has to strategically move throug the maze.

OBJECTIVE:
If the player makes it to the 'exit' (the opening located on the right wall) without hitting any land mines, they are able to move on to the next level by pressing any key or exit by typing 'E' and pressing [enter].
